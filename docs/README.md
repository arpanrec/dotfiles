# My Dotfiles and Scripts Repository

* Caution: If some of my choices trigger you always remember the legend named `xkcd` and his wisdom about workflow which can be found [here in 1172](https://xkcd.com/1172/). If you are too lazy to read, just know "My setup works for me".

This repository contains my dotfiles and scripts, which I use to set up and configure my development environment. These files are essential for my workflow and help me maintain a consistent environment across different machines.
