# My Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files in Linux that start with a dot (e.g. .bashrc, .zshrc).
They are used to customize and configure your system and applications.
In this repository, you'll find my personal dotfiles for various applications and tools, including:

- Bash: [.bashrc](/.bashrc), [.bash_profile](/.bash_profile)
- Zsh: [.zshrc](/.zshrc), [.p10k.zsh](/.p10k.zsh)
- SSH: [.ssh/config](/.ssh/config)
- And more...
